            <p class="p1">Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The
                novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends, Hermione Granger and Ron
                Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc
                concerns
                Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard
                governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and Muggles</p>
            <p class="p2">The series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and
                Scholastic
                Press in the United States. A series of many genres, including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction,
                and
                the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance),
                the
                world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.[1]
                Major
                themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, madness, love, and death.[2]</p>
            <p class="p3">Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June
                1997,
                the books have found immense popularity and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide
                adult
                audience as well as younger readers and are widely considered cornerstones of modern literature,[3][4]
                though the books have received mixed reviews from critics and literary scholars. As of February 2023,
                the
                books have sold more than 600 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in
                history,
                available in dozens of languages. The last four books all set records as the fastest-selling books in
                history, with the final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3
                million
                copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.</p>
            <p class="p4">The series follows the life of a boy named Harry Potter. In the first book, Harry Potter and
                the
                Philosopher's Stone (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the US), Harry lives in a cupboard under
                the
                stairs in the house of the Dursleys, his aunt, uncle and cousin, who all treat him poorly. At the age of
                11,
                Harry discovers that he is a wizard. He meets a half-giant named Hagrid who gives him a letter of
                acceptance
                to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents, Lily and James
                Potter, also had magical powers and were murdered by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort when Harry was a
                baby.
                When Voldemort attempted to kill Harry, his curse rebounded, seemingly killing Voldemort, and Harry
                survived
                with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. The event made Harry famous among the community of wizards
                and
                witches.</p>
