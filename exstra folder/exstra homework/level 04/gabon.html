        <p class="p1">Marvel Studios releases its films in groups called "Phases", with the first three phases collectively known
            as "The Infinity Saga" and the following three phases as "The Multiverse Saga". The first MCU film, Iron Man
            (2008), began Phase One which culminated in the 2012 crossover film The Avengers. Phase Two began with Iron
            Man 3 (2013) and concluded with Ant-Man (2015), while Phase Three began with Captain America: Civil War
            (2016) and concluded with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Black Widow (2021) is the first film in Phase
            Four, which concluded with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022), while Phase Five began with Ant-Man and
            the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) and will conclude with Thunderbolts* (2025). Phase Six will begin with The
            Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025) and it will conclude with Avengers: Doomsday (2026) and Avengers: Secret
            Wars (2027).</p>
        <p class="p2">The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series
            of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in American
            comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes several television series, short films,
            digital series, and literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books,
            was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.</p>
        <p class="p3">expanded the universe to network television with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in 2013 before further
            expanding to streaming television on Netflix and Hulu and to cable television on Freeform. They also
            produced the digital series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot (2016). Marvel Studios began producing their
            own television series for streaming on Disney+, starting with WandaVision in 2021 as the beginning of Phase
            Four. That phase also saw the studio expand to television specials, known as Marvel Studios Special
            Presentations, starting with Werewolf by Night (2022). The MCU includes various tie-in comics published by
            Marvel Comics, a series of direct-to-video short films called Marvel One-Shots from 2011 to 2014, and viral
            marketing campaigns for some films featuring the faux news programs WHIH Newsfront (2015–16) and The Daily
            Bugle (2019–2022).</p>
        <p class="p4">By 2005, Marvel Entertainment was planning to produce its own films independently and distribute them through
            Paramount Pictures.[1] Previously, Marvel had co-produced several superhero films based on Marvel Comics
            with Columbia Pictures, New Line Cinema, 20th Century Fox, and others.[2] Marvel made relatively little
            profit from these licensing deals and wanted to get more money out of its films while maintaining artistic
            control of the projects and distribution.[3] Avi Arad, head of Marvel Entertainment's film division known as
            Marvel Films, was pleased with director Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film trilogy (2002–2007) at Sony Pictures and
            Columbia but was less enthused with some of the other films. Arad decided to form Marvel Studios,
            Hollywood's first major independent film studio since DreamWorks Pictures was founded in 1994. Kevin Feige,
            Arad's second-in-command,[4] realized that unlike Spider-Man, Blade, and the X-Men which were respectively
            licensed to Sony, New Line, and Fox, Marvel owned the rights to the Avengers team. Feige, a self-described
            "fanboy", envisioned combining these characters in a shared universe similar to the one created by Stan Lee
            and Jack Kirby for Marvel Comics in the 1960s.[5]</p>
