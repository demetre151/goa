        <h1>Chelsea</h1>
        <p class="p1">Chelsea Football Club is a professional football club based in Fulham, West London, England. They
            compete in
            the
            Premier League, the top tier of English football. Founded in 1905, the team play their home games at
            Stamford
            Bridge.[4] The club won their first major honour, the League championship, in 1955. They won the FA Cup for
            the
            first time in 1970, won their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup, in 1971, and became the third
            English
            club to win the Club World Cup in 2022</p>
        <p class="p2">Chelsea is one of five clubs and the first English club to have won all three pre-1999 main
            European club
            competitions, the "European Treble" of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League, European/UEFA Cup Winners'
            Cup,
            and UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League.[5] They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions
            twice. They are the only London club to have won the Champions League and the Club World Cup.[6]
            Domestically,
            the club has won six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields.
            Internationally, they have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup
            and
            the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once. In terms of overall trophies won, Chelsea
            is
            the fifth-most successful club in English football.</p>

        <p class="p3">The club has rivalries with neighbouring teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, and a historic
            rivalry with
            Leeds
            United. In terms of club value, Chelsea is the ninth-most-valuable football club in the world (as of 2024),
            worth $3.13 billion, and is the ninth-highest-earning football club in the world.[7][8]</p>
        <p class="p4">In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium in Fulham with the aim of
            turning it into a
            football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham F.C. was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own
            club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent
            borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC
            were
            considered.[9] Chelsea F.C. was founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's
            Hook),[1][10]
            opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League
            shortly afterwards.</p>
        <p class="p5">Chelsea won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First
            and Second
            Divisions in its early years. The team reached the 1915 FA Cup final, where they lost to Sheffield United at
            Old
            Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the club's best league campaign to that
            point.[11]
            Chelsea had a reputation for signing star players[12] and attracted large crowds. The club had the highest
            average attendance in English football in ten separate seasons[13] including 1907–08,[14] 1909–10,[15]
            1911–12,[16] 1912–13,[17] 1913–14[18] and 1919–20.[19][20] They were FA Cup semi-finalists in 1920 and 1932
            and
            remained in the First Division throughout the 1930s, but success eluded the club in the inter-war years.</p>
